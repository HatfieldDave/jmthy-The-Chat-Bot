Step 1 Get a to-do list and a timer. |
Step 2 Set your timer for 25 minutes and focus on a single task from your to-do list until the timer rings. |
Step 3 When your session ends, mark off one pomodoro (one pomodoro = one 25-minute session) and record what you completed. |
Step 4 Then enjoy a five-minute break. |
Step 5 After four Pomodoros, take a longer, more restorative 15-30 minute break. |
Cirillo Also Cites 3 Rules For The Pomodoro Technique: |
Rule 1 Break down complex projects. If a task requires more than four Pomodoros, it needs to be divided into smaller, actionable steps. Sticking to this rule will help ensure you make clear progress on your projects. |
Rule 2 Small tasks go together. Any tasks that will take less than one Pomodoro should be combined with other simple tasks. For example, "write rent check," "set vet appointment," and "read Pomodoro article" could go together in one session. |
Rule 3 Once a pomodoro is set, it must ring. | The pomodoro is an indivisible unit of time and cannot be broken, especially not to check incoming emails, team chats, or text messages. Any ideas, tasks, or requests that come up should be taken note of to come back to later.',
